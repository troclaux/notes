- first class functions:

- pure functions
  1. They always return the same value given the same arguments
  2. Running them causes no side effects
    - site effect: any observable change in the state of the program or its interaction with the outside world that occurs when a function is executed

## recursion instead of loops

## function transformation

> function that receives function1 as input and returns function2


## closures
## currying
## decorators

## python functional programming

- map(): 
- filter(): 
- reduce():
