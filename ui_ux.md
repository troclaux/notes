## core principles of UI/UX design

- user-centered design: always design with the user's needs, preferences and goals in mind
- usability: product should be easy to use and understand
- consistency: use consistent design patterns for colors, fonts, buttons and layouts
- accessibility: build products that can be used by users with disabilities (e.g. colorblindness, motos impairments)
- visual hierarchy: guide the user's attention by prioritizing important elements
- feedback: provide feedback to user's actions
- iterative design: test your designs frequently and improve based on user feedback

## tools

- wireframe: simple visual representation of the product's layout
  - made with simple shapes, lines and text
  - usually made with pencil and paper
- personas: fictional characters created to represent the target audience of the product
  - used to help designers understand the needs, goals of their users
  - typically contains the user's personal info: name, age, occupation, goals, pain points
- user journey: visualization representation of the steps a user takes to achieve a goal on a website
  - used to map the user's experience and pain points
  - typically includes the following points:
    - start
    - goal
    - steps
    - pain points: difficulties of the client during the journey
    - end
- user story: brief description of a user's goal or problem that a product or service should solve
  - typically includes the following statements:
    - `as a`: a description of the user, often in the form of a persona
    - `i want to`: a statement of the user's goal or need
    - `so that`: a description of the benefit or value that the user will gain from achieving their goal
  - format: `as a [user type], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]`
  - example: "As a busy professional, I want to be able to quickly and easily find the information I need on the company intranet, so that I can stay up-to-date on company news and projects."

## design thinking

> problem-solving approach that focuses on understanding the needs of users, brainstorming ideas and testing practical solutions

- iterative process composed by the following steps:
  - empathize
  - define the problem
  - ideate: brainstorm solutions
  - prototype
  - test: validate the solution
