- user-centered design: always design with the user's needs, preferences and goals in mind
- usability: product should be easy to use and understand
- consistency: use consistent design patterns for colors, fonts, buttons and layouts
- accessibility: build products that can be used by users with disabilities (e.g. colorblindness, motos impairments)
- visual hierarchy: guide the user's attention by prioritizing important elements
- feedback: provide feedback to user's actions
- iterative design: test your designs frequently and improve based on user feedback
