# SOLID Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only one reason to change

- a class should have only one job
- if a class has more than one job, it should be split into multiple classes


## Open/Closed Principle

> A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification

- a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself


## Liskov Substitution Principle

> Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality of the program


## Interface Segregation Principle

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesnâ€™t use

- a class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't use

## Dependency Inversion Principle

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions

- abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions
- high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions
