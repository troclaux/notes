# AWS

> cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services and tools for building and managing applications and infrastructure in the cloud

- cloud computing: the delivery of computing services over the internet
- service: a software that provides functionality and performs a task or set of tasks for your system
  - examples:
    - apache
    - nginx
    - postgresql
    - auth0
    - prometheus
- infrastructure: the physical or virtual resources that support the operation of a system
  - e.g. servers, storage, network, databases, etc

- pricing of AWS
  - pay for compute time
  - pay for data stored in the cloud
  - pay only for data transfer out of the cloud
    - data transfer in is free

- options to manage aws
  - aws management console
  - aws CLI
  - aws SDK: allows the access and management of aws services programmatically

- reliability: ability to recover from failures and maintain availability
  - dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand

- region: geographic area (e.g. `us-east-1` or `sa-east-1`)
  - each region is completely independent from others
  - each region has 3 to 6 Availability Zones, with few exceptions

- IAM users: individual
- IAM groups: collections of IAM users
- AWS organizations: allows management of multiple AWS accounts under one umbrella

## best practices

- least privilege principle: concede the minimum amount of privileges as possible
- Don't use root account (except for aws account setup)
- Don't create multiple aws accounts, create aws users within an aws account

## AWS CLI

> manage aws resources with CLI commands

- list all IAM users in your AWS account: `aws iam list-users`
- get secret from aws secrets manager: `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id peso-env-secret --region sa-east-1`

## IAM (Identity and Access Management)

> manage access to AWS services and resources securely

### Policy structure

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy12345",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowListBuckets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowGetObjects",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `Version`: the version of the policy language, defined by date
- `ID`: optional identifier for the policy
- `Statement`: contains individual permission rules
  - `"Sid": "AllowListBuckets"` (Statement ID): unique identifier for this permission block
  - `Effect`: defines if this permission is allowed or not
  - `"Action": "s3:GetObject"`: allows the use to list objects in the root of the specified S3 bucket
  - `Resource`: list of resources to which the actions apply
  - `Condition`: conditions for when this policy is in effect

- IAM Password Policy: You can decide the requirements for password creation

- MFA (Multi Factor Authentication): multi-step account login process that requires users to enter more information than just a password
  - e.g. password && (code sent to email || secret question || fingerprint scan)

- Options to access AWS:
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
  - AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK)
    - Used whenever you want to call APIs

- IAM Policy: set of permissions for aws resources
  - a policy can exist without a role, but a role can't do anything useful without a policy
- IAM Roles: identity that grants temporary permissions to aws services or users to perform tasks
  - set of IAM policies

### IAM role

> identity in aws that you can assume temporarily to get specific permissions

- use cases
  - grant temporary access to aws services without long-term credentials
  - assign permissions to services like ec2 or lambda
  - to switch roles across accounts securely

- key components of a role:
  - trust policy: defines who can assume the role (e.g. ec2, lambda, another account)
  - permissions policy defines what the role can do (e.g. access s3, write logs)
  - session duration
  - assume role


### IAM Security Tools

- IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
  - Use this information to revise your policies (Least privilege principle)

### IAM Guidelines and Best Practices

- don't use the root account (except for aws account setup)
- don't create multiple aws accounts, create aws users within an aws account
- assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
  - if you are responsible for the company resources
    - create a groups with the policy "administrator access" and create an aws user that belongs to this group
- create strong password policy
  - use and enforce MFA
- create and use roles to give permisssions to aws srevices

- dedicated host: your instance runs on a physical server fully dedicated to your use
  - an isolated server with configurations you can control

## security groups

> facilitates managing network traffic

- acts as a "firewall" for EC2 instances
- regulate:
  - access to ports
  - authorized IP ranges (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - control of inbound and outbound network traffic
- can be attached to multiple instances
- locked down to a region/VPC combination
- lives "outside" the EC2
  - if traffic is blocked, the EC2 instance wonâ€™t see it
- it's good to keep 1 separate security group for SSH access
- if your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue
- if you application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched

> [!IMPORTANT]
> all inbound traffic is blocked by default
> all outbound traffic is authorized by default

- Ports:
  - 22 = SSH (Secure Shell): log into a linux instance
  - 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): log into a windows instance
  - 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
  - 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
  - 80 = HTTP : access unsecured websites
  - 443 = HTTPS: access secured websites

#### security groups vs firewalls

| Feature | AWS Security Groups | Traditional Firewalls (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`) |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Level | AWS-level (cloud) | OS-level (server) |
| Type | Virtual firewall for EC2 and services | Software firewall on the OS |
| Rules | Stateful (return traffic automatically allowed) | Stateful or stateless |
| Scope | Applied per EC2 instance | Applies to whole server |
| Use Case | Allow inbound on port 22 from your IP, or 443 to everyone | Block/allow ports directly on EC2 OS |

### SSH Access

- Create an identity file `.pem` for SSH:
  - EC2 Dashboard > Key Pair > Create Key Pair
  - Copy the public IP of the instance (used in the SSH command)
  - Move the `.pem` file to a secure location and restrict permissions:
    - `chmod 0400 <file>.pem`
  - SSH into the instance:
    - `ssh -i <file>.pem ec2-user@<public_IP>`

## EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

> compute service that allows you to launch virtual servers in the cloud

- instance: a virtual server in the cloud
- AMI: a template for your instance (OS + configs)
- EBS (Elastic Block Store): persistent block storage for instances
- Security Groups: virtual firewalls that control traffic
- key pairs: used for SSH access to Linux or RDP to Windows instances
- elastic IP: static public IP address for your instance

1. choose an AMI (ubuntu, amazon linux, windows, etc)
1. choose an instance type (e.g. t2.micro, m5.large)
1. configure instance details (VPC, subnet, IAM role, etc.)
1. add storage (EBS volumes)
1. add tags (e.g. MyServer)
1. configure security group (firewall rules)
1. launch (with a key pair for SSH)

- pricing models
  - on-demand: ideal for short-term use, expensive
  - reserved: commit to 1 or 3 years, cheaper
  - spot instances: bid for unused capacity, cheapest

### ec2 instance tenancy

- shared (default): multiple aws accounts may share the same physical hardware
- dedicated instance: your instance runs on single-tenant hardware
- dedicated host: your instance runs on a physical server with ec2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use

### EBS (Elastic Block Store)

> provides block-level storage that can be attached to ec2 instances

- tightly integrated with Amazon EC2
- block-level storage: refers to a type of data storage where data is saved in fixed-sized chunks called blocks
  - each block has its own address, and the system (like an operating system or a database) can read/write to these blocks individually

## lambda

> serverless compute service that lets you run code in response to events

- examples of events
  - file uploads
  - http requests
  - database changes

- properties
  - serverless
  - event-driven
  - short-lived functions: each invocation runs in an isolated environment with max duration of 15 minutes
  - stateless: each function runs independently

### workflow

1. write a function in Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc
1. deploy it to Lambda (manually, with the CLI, or using IaC like Terraform)
1. configure a trigger (e.g. HTTP endpoint, S3 upload)
1. lambda runs your code when the event occurs
1. get billed per request and per compute time (in milliseconds)

use case example: resize images uploaded to an S3 bucket

1. upload triggers an S3 event
1. aws Lambda receives the event, processes the image (e.g. resizes it)
1. stores the output back to S3

## S3 - Simple Storage Service

> scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web

- use cases
  - backup and restore
  - [data lake](/data_warehouse.md#types-of-data-repositories) and analytics
  - web hosting (static files)
  - media storage and distribution
  - application assets (images, audio, etc)
  - log storage

- properties
  - serverless: no server or infrastructure to manage
  - scalable: automatically scales to any amount of data
  - durable
  - event-driven: can trigger lambda, sqs, sns on object creation or deletion
  - durable: 11 9s (99.999999999%) durability

- key: unique identifier for an object within a bucket (often a filename or path)
- object: stored data (file + metadata + unique key)
- url structure to an s3 object: `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>`
  - `https://my-unique-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documents/report.pdf`
- bucket: container that stores objects (like a folder)
  - must have unique name globally
- region: bucket location (affects latency)
- storage class: determines availability, durability and cost
  - standard: frequently accesses data
    - instant data retrieval
    - expensive
  - intelligent-tiering: automatically moves data between frequent/infrequent tiers
    - instant-minutes retrieval
    - moderate cost + monitoring fee
  - glacier: long-term storage
    - 12+ hours to retrieve data
    - cheap

- versioning: option to retain multiple versions of objects
- can host static sites
- there are no real folders
- the key must be unique in the bucket

- compatible databases:
  - [postgresql](./postgresql.md)
  - [mysql](./mysql.md)
  - [mariadb](./mariadb.md)
  - oracle
  - microsoft sql server
  - aurora

### workflow

1. create a bucket (e.g. `my-app-assets` in `sa-east-1`)
1. upload an object (`logo.png`)
1. access it with: `https://my-app-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/logo.png`
1. use IAM policies or s3 bucket policies to control access

#### aws cli example

```bash
# create a bucket
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name

# upload a file
aws s3 cp ./file.txt s3://my-bucket-name/

# download a file
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket-name/file.txt .

# list files
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket-name/
```

### shared responsibility model

- aws is responsible for
  - infrastructure
    - global security
    - durability
    - availability
    - sustain concurrent loss of data in 2 facilities
  - configuration and vulnerability analysis
  - compliance validation
- me
  - s3 versioning
  - s3 bucket policies
  - s3 replication setup
  - logging and monitoring
  - s3 storage classes
  - data encryption at rest and in transit

## EBS - Elastic Block Store

> block storage service that allows you to create and attach storage volumes to EC2 instances

## VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

> virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the cloud

- allows management over IP addresses, subnets, routing and security
- allows the creation of public and private subnets
  - subnet: smaller network inside larger network
    - helps organize and manage traffic in a network by dividing it into chunks
    - subnets allow better allocation of IPs from a larger IP range
    - each subnet in aws is associated with one route table
    - use CIDR notation (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`)

- public vs private subnet
  - public subnets have route to internet gateway
    - this means:
      - instances can send traffic to the internet
      - instances can receive traffic from the internet, if security rules allows it
  - private subnets do not have route to internet gateway
    - this means:
      - instances CANNOT initiate outbound internet traffic (unless via NAT gateway)
      - instances CANNOT receive ANY inbound traffic directly from the internet

- route table: defines how traffic flows inside VPC
  - contains rules like:
    - to reach the internet (0.0.0.0/0), go through the Internet Gateway
    - to reach the private subnet, stay local
  - each subnet is associated with a route table
  - only one route table per subnet is allowed

- internet gateway: allows public subnets to access the internet and receive traffic from it
  - attached to a VPC
  - required for ec2 instances in public subnets to:
    - download packages
    - be accessed via SSH or a browser
- NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway: allows private subnets to access the internet, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection back
  - e.g. private ec2 can download updates or access external APIs without being publicly exposed
  - usually are placed in a public subnet and route private subnet traffic through it

## RDS - Relational Database Service

## Route 53

> scalable domain name system (DNS) web service that translates domain names into IP addresses

- hosted zone: logical container within aws route 53 that holds DNS records for domains
  - DNS records: maps domain name to a specific resource (e.g. IP address, mail server)
    - types:
      - `A` (Address): points a domain/subdomain directly to a public IPv4 address
      - `CNAME` (Canonical NAME): redirects one domain or subdomain to another domain or subdomain
      - `MX` (Mail Exchange): specifies mail exchange servers for receiving email
      - `TXT` (TeXT): holds text information, often used for verification purposes or SPF records (email authentication)
    - what is a dns record?
    - explain each type of dns record
    - logical container: not a docker container, it's a logical group/repository with dns records
  - NS (NameServer records): indicate authoritative server for the domain
  - authoritative NS record: specifies which nameservers have definitive information about dns records for the domain
  - domain registrar: responsible for managing official domain records, registration, renewals and assignments

```
Visitor enters URL â†’ Domain Registrar â†’ Nameservers â†’ Hosted Zone â†’ DNS Records â†’ IP Address
```

### registering domain

1. access route 53 in AWS console
1. select "Register Domains"
1. insert/search/choose a domain
1. enter contact information
1. review details, pricing and accept terms (select to renew domain yearly, if you want to)
1. finalize registration

- registering a domain automatically cretes a hosted zone
- if you delete it, you can easily copy the registered domain's name servers and create a new record

example of Name Servers:

```
ns-123.awsdns-01.com
ns-1234.awsdns-01.org
ns-123.awsdns-01.net
ns-1234.awsdns-01.co.uk
```

---

- serverless: server doesn't requires provisioning and scaling
  - e.g. aws lambda, azure functions, google cloud functions
- Read replica: is a copy of a database that can be used to offload read operations from the primary database
- server provisioning: the process of setting up physical or virtual hardware; installing and configuring software, such as the operating system and applications; and connecting it to middleware, network, and storage components
- failover: ability of a system or service to automatically switch to a backup or secondary system when the primary system becomes unavailable or experiences a failure. This is important for ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime for critical applications and services.
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): virtual network infrastructure that allows users to provision a logically isolated section where they can launch AWS resources in a virtual network
- topology: the arrangement of nodes or devices in a network
  - e.g. star, ring, bus, mesh, tree
- cluster: a group of interconnected computers or servers that work together to perform a specific task or function
  - commonly used in high-performance computing, data processing, and distributed systems to improve performance, scalability, and fault tolerance
  - resources are shared and coordinated to achieve a common goal
- grid: distributed computing system that connects multiple computers or servers to work together on a common task or problem
  - decentralized
- hybrid service: service that can operate both in the cloud and on-premises
