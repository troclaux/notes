# AWS

> cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services and tools for building and managing applications and infrastructure in the cloud

- cloud computing: the delivery of computing services over the internet
- service: a software that provides functionality and performs a task or set of tasks for your system
  - examples:
    - apache
    - nginx
    - postgresql
    - auth0
    - prometheus
- infrastructure: the physical or virtual resources that support the operation of a system
  - e.g. servers, storage, network, databases, etc

- types of pricing in AWS
  - pay for compute time
  - pay for data stored in the cloud
  - pay only for data transfer out of the cloud
    - data transfer in is free

- options to manage aws
  - aws management console
  - aws CLI
  - aws SDK: allows the access and management of aws services programmatically

- reliability: ability to recover from failures and maintain availability
  - dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- high availability: design and implementation of systems that are resilient to failures and can continue operating with minimal downtime
  - running instances for the same application on at least 2 Availability Zones
  - key characteristics
    - redundancy
    - failover mechanisms
    - geographic distribution
    - health monitoring
    - scalability and elasticity

- region: separate geographic areas (e.g. `us-east-1` or `sa-east-1`)
  - each region is completely independent from others
  - each region has 3 to 6 Availability Zones, with few exceptions (AZ âŠ† region)
    - Availability Zone (AZ): isolated locations within each region

- IAM users: individual
- IAM groups: collections of IAM users
- AWS organizations: allows management of multiple AWS accounts under one umbrella
  - allows management of permissions
  - AWS organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs): centrally manage and restrict permissions across all accounts

- shared responsibility model: the line of responsibility shifts based on the level of abstraction provided by the service
  - aws is responsible for security **OF** the cloud
    - buildings, computers, storage, network systems, base software (hypervisors, etc)
  - I am responsible for security **IN** the cloud
    - you protect what you do inside the cloud
      - files, data, etc

## AWS CLI

> manage aws resources with CLI commands

- list all IAM users in your AWS account: `aws iam list-users`
- get secret from aws secrets manager: `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id peso-env-secret --region sa-east-1`

## IAM (Identity and Access Management)

> manage access to AWS services and resources securely

### Policy structure

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy12345",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowListBuckets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowGetObjects",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `Version`: the version of the policy language, defined by date
- `ID`: optional identifier for the policy
- `Statement`: contains individual permission rules
  - `"Sid": "AllowListBuckets"` (Statement ID): unique identifier for this permission block
  - `Effect`: defines if this permission is allowed or not
  - `"Action": "s3:GetObject"`: allows the use to list objects in the root of the specified S3 bucket
  - `Resource`: list of resources to which the actions apply
  - `Condition`: conditions for when this policy is in effect

- IAM Password Policy: You can decide the requirements for password creation

- MFA (Multi Factor Authentication): multi-step account login process that requires users to enter more information than just a password
  - e.g. password && (code sent to email || secret question || fingerprint scan)

- Options to access AWS:
  - AWS Management Console
  - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
  - AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK)
    - Used whenever you want to call APIs

- IAM Policy: set of permissions for aws resources
  - a policy can exist without a role, but a role can't do anything useful without a policy
- IAM Roles: identity that grants temporary permissions to aws services or users to perform tasks
  - set of IAM policies

### IAM role

> identity in aws that you can assume temporarily to get specific permissions

- use cases
  - grant temporary access to aws services without long-term credentials
  - assign permissions to services like ec2 or lambda
  - to switch roles across accounts securely

- key components of a role:
  - trust policy: defines who can assume the role (e.g. ec2, lambda, another account)
  - permissions policy defines what the role can do (e.g. access s3, write logs)
  - session duration
  - assume role

### shared responsibility

- aws
  - infrastructure
  - configuration and vulnerability analysis
  - compliance validation
- me
  - users, groups, roles, policies, management and monitoring
  - enable MFA on all accounts
  - rotate all keys often
  - use iam tools to apply appropriate permissions

### IAM Security Tools

- IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
  - use this information to revise your policies (least privilege principle)
- IAM policy simulator: test and debug IAM policies to check what actions are allowed/denied for specific users, groups, roles

### IAM Guidelines and Best Practices

- don't use the root account (except for aws account setup)
- don't create multiple aws accounts, create aws users within an aws account
- assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
  - if you are responsible for the company resources
    - create a groups with the policy "administrator access" and create an aws user that belongs to this group
- create strong password policy
  - use and enforce MFA
- create and use roles to give permisssions to aws srevices

- dedicated host: your instance runs on a physical server fully dedicated to your use
  - an isolated server with configurations you can control

## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

> virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the cloud

- allows management over IP addresses, subnets, routing and security
- must have a CIDR block
- allows the creation of public and private subnets
  - subnet: smaller network inside larger network
    - helps organize and manage traffic in a network by dividing it into chunks
    - subnets allow better allocation of IPs from a larger IP range
    - each subnet in aws is associated with one route table
    - use CIDR notation (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`)

- **public vs private subnet**
  - public subnets have route to internet gateway
    - this means:
      - instances can send traffic to the internet
      - instances can receive traffic from the internet, if security rules allows it
  - private subnets do not have route to internet gateway
    - this means:
      - instances CANNOT initiate outbound internet traffic (unless via NAT gateway)
      - instances CANNOT receive ANY inbound traffic directly from the internet

- route table: defines how traffic flows inside VPC
  - contains rules like:
    - to reach the internet (0.0.0.0/0), go through the Internet Gateway
    - to reach the private subnet, stay local
  - each subnet is associated with a route table
  - only one route table per subnet is allowed

| Feature    | Route Tables       | Security Groups            |
| ---------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Scope      | Subnet-level       | Instance-level             |
| Purpose    | Direct traffic     | Allow or deny traffic      |
| Layer      | Layer 3 (Network)  | Layer 4 (Transport)        |
| Stateful?  | No                 | Yes                        |
| Controls   | Where traffic goes | Whether traffic is allowed |
| Applied To | Subnets            | EC2 instances, ENIs        |

- internet gateway: allows public subnets to access the internet and receive traffic from it
  - attached to a VPC
  - required for ec2 instances in public subnets to:
    - download packages
    - be accessed via SSH or a browser
- NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway: allows private subnets to access the internet, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection back
  - e.g. private ec2 can download updates or access external APIs without being publicly exposed
  - usually are placed in a public subnet and route private subnet traffic through it

## security groups

> facilitates managing network traffic

- acts as a "firewall"
- define:
  - access to ports
  - authorized IP ranges (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - control of inbound and outbound network traffic
- can be attached to multiple instances
- locked down to a region/VPC combination
- lives "outside" the EC2
  - if traffic is blocked, the EC2 instance won't see it

> [!TIP]
> it's good to keep 1 separate security group for SSH access.
> if your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue.
> if you application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> all inbound traffic is blocked by default
> all outbound traffic is authorized by default

- Ports:
  - 22 = SSH (Secure Shell): log into a linux instance
  - 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): log into a windows instance
  - 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
  - 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
  - 80 = HTTP : access unsecured websites
  - 443 = HTTPS: access secured websites

#### security groups vs firewalls

| Feature | AWS Security Groups | Traditional Firewalls (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`) |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Level | AWS-level (cloud) | OS-level (server) |
| Type | Virtual firewall for EC2 and services | Software firewall on the OS |
| Rules | Stateful (return traffic automatically allowed) | Stateful or stateless |
| Scope | Applied per EC2 instance | Applies to whole server |
| Use Case | Allow inbound on port 22 from your IP, or 443 to everyone | Block/allow ports directly on EC2 OS |

### SSH Access

- Create an identity file `.pem` for SSH:
  - EC2 Dashboard > Key Pair > Create Key Pair
  - Copy the public IP of the instance (used in the SSH command)
  - Move the `.pem` file to a secure location and restrict permissions:
    - `chmod 0400 <file>.pem`
  - SSH into the instance:
    - `ssh -i <file>.pem ec2-user@<public_IP>`

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

> compute service that allows you to launch virtual servers in the cloud

- instance: a virtual server in the cloud
- AMI: a template for your instance (OS + configs)
- EBS (Elastic Block Store): persistent block storage for instances
- Security Groups: virtual firewalls that control traffic
- key pairs: used for SSH access to Linux or RDP to Windows instances
- elastic IP: static public IP address for your instance

1. choose an AMI (ubuntu, amazon linux, windows, etc)
1. choose an instance type (e.g. t2.micro, m5.large)
1. configure instance details (VPC, subnet, IAM role, etc.)
1. add storage (EBS volumes)
1. add tags (e.g. MyServer)
1. configure security group (firewall rules)
1. launch (with a key pair for SSH)

- inbound traffic: instance <= traffic = outside
- outbound traffic: instance = traffic => outside

### shared responsibility model

- aws
  - infrastructure (global network security)
  - isolation on physical host
  - replacing faulty hardware
  - compliance validation
- me
  - security groups rules
  - OS patches and updates
  - software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance
  - IAM roles assigned to EC2 instances
  - IAM user access management
  - data security on your instance

### purchasing options

- on-demand: ideal for short-term use, expensive
  - predictable pricing
  - highest cost but no upfront payment
  - no long-term commitment
- reserved: commit to 1 or 3 years, cheaper
  - long workloads
  - up to 72% discount compared to on-demand
- spot instances: bid for unused capacity, cheapest
  - no guaranteed availability, aws can terminate them when the spot price exceeds your bid price
- savings plans
  - commitment to an amount of usage
  - discount based on long-term usage
- capacity reservations
- dedicated instances
- dedicated hosts

### sizing and configuration options

- os
- cpu
- ram
- storage space
  - network-attached (ebs and efs)
  - hardware (ec2 instance store)
- network card
- firewall rules: security group
- ec2 user data: script that is launched at the first start of an instance

#### right sizing

> process of looking at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements, which results in lower costs

- when to right size:
  - before a cloud migration
  - continuously after the cloud onboarding process (requirements change over time)

- tools that can help
  - cloudwatch
  - cost explorer
  - trusted advisor

### ec2 instance tenancy

- shared (default): multiple aws accounts may share the same physical hardware
- dedicated instance: instance runs on single-tenant hardware
- dedicated host: instance runs on a physical server with ec2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use

### ec2 image builder

> automate the creation, testing and distribution of AMIs or container images

- can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updated, etc)

1. ec2 image builder initiates temporary builder ec2 instance
1. temporary builder ec2 instance builds the image
1. once the image is built, it is saved as an AMI
1. new ec2 instance is launched to test ec2 instance, if it fails, the pipeline stops here
1. if the test is successful, the AMI is made available to other aws regions or accounts

### local ec2 instance store

> fast, ephemeral block-level storage that is physically attached to the host machine running your ec2 instance

- block-level storage: disk is composed by blocks
  - each block has a unique address
  - os can read/write any block
- high-performance hardware disk
- **loses storage if stopped (ephemeral)**
- good buffer/cache/temporary content
- risk of data loss if hardware fails
- backups and replication are your responsibility

### EBS (Elastic Block Store)

> provides block-level storage that can be attached to ec2 instances

- tightly integrated with Amazon EC2
- block-level storage: refers to a type of data storage where data is saved in fixed-sized chunks called blocks
  - each block has its own address
  - the system can read/write to these blocks individually

#### EBS snapshots

> backup for an ebs volume

- it's recommended to detach ebs volume to do a snapshot
- use ebs snapshots as a buffer to copy ebs volumes across AZ

## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

> scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web

- use cases
  - storage
  - backup and restore
  - application hosting
  - static websites
  - [data lake](/data_warehouse.md#types-of-data-repositories) and big data analytics
  - web hosting (static files)
  - media storage and distribution
  - application assets (images, audio, etc)
  - log storage

- properties
  - serverless: no server or infrastructure to manage
  - scalable: automatically scales to any amount of data
  - durable
  - event-driven: can trigger lambda, sqs, sns on object creation or deletion
  - durable: 11 9s (99.999999999%) durability

- versioning: option to retain multiple versions of objects
- there are no real folders
- max object size is 5 TB
  - if file is bigger than 5 TB, upload is segmented into multiple parts

- server-side encryption is enabled by default (instead of client-side encryption)
- you can enable public access with an S3 bucket policy
- to give user access to S3, use IAM policy to give access
- to give access to an EC2 instance, always use EC2 instance roles with IAM permissions
- to give access to IAM User in another AWS account, create a bucket policy that allows access to that specific user

- key: unique identifier for an object within a bucket (often a filename or path)
  - must be unique in the bucket
  - similar to full file path
    - aren't directories, just long names that contain slashes ("/")
  - prefix: path without file name
- object (similar to file): stored data (file + metadata + unique key)
- url structure to an s3 object: `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>`
  - `https://my-unique-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documents/report.pdf`
- bucket (similar to directory): container that stores objects
  - must have unique name globally
  - created in a region
  - pay attention to naming requirements
    - 3 to 63 characters
    - no spaces or underscores
    - no leading or trailing dots or hyphens
    - names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, periods and hyphens
- region: bucket location (affects latency)

> [!NOTE]
> When you upload data (objects), server-side encryption is enabled by default, rather than client-side encryption.
> Server-side encryption ensures that this stored data is encrypted so that even if someone gains access to the raw storage, they can't read your data.

- compatible databases:
  - [postgresql](./postgresql.md)
  - [mysql](./mysql.md)
  - [mariadb](./mariadb.md)
  - oracle
  - microsoft sql server
  - aurora

- bucket policies examples:
  - you can enable public access with an S3 Bucket Policy
  - to give user access to S3, use IAM policy to give access
  - to give access to an EC2 instance, always use EC2 instance roles with IAM permissions
  - to give access to IAM User in another AWS account, create a bucket policy that allows access to that specific user

> [!WARNING]
> to fix 403 error, you need to give public access to your bucket

### workflow

1. create a bucket (e.g. `my-app-assets` in `sa-east-1`)
1. upload an object (`logo.png`)
1. access it with: `https://my-app-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/logo.png`
1. use IAM policies or s3 bucket policies to control access

#### aws cli example

```bash
# create a bucket
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name

# upload a file
aws s3 cp ./file.txt s3://my-bucket-name/

# download a file
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket-name/file.txt .

# list files
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket-name/
```

### shared responsibility model

- aws is responsible for
  - infrastructure
    - global security
    - durability
    - availability
    - sustain concurrent loss of data in 2 facilities
  - configuration and vulnerability analysis
  - compliance validation
- me
  - s3 versioning
  - s3 bucket policies
  - s3 replication setup
  - logging and monitoring
  - s3 storage classes
  - data encryption at rest and in transit

### storage classes

> determines availability, durability and cost

- durability: how many times an object is going to be lost by S3 (likelihood of data loss)
  - same for all storages classes: 99.999999999% (11 9's)
- availability: percentage of time where a service is available
  - varies depending on storage class

- standard: frequently accesses data
  - use cases: big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications, content distribution
  - instant data retrieval
  - most expensive
- intelligent-tiering: automatically moves data between frequent/infrequent tiers
  - tiers:
    - frequent access tier: default tier
    - infrequent access tier: objects not accessed for 30 days
    - archive instant access tier: objects not accessed for 90 days
    - archive access tier: configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
    - deep archive access tier: configurable from 180 days to 700+ days
- standard IA (Infrequent Access)
  - pay to retrieve data
  - 99% availability
  - use cases: disaster recovery, backups
- one zone-IA
  - high durability in a single AZ
  - 99.5% availability
- glacier: long-term storage
  - cheap
  - types:
    - glacier instant retrieval
    - glacier flexible retrieval
      - retrieval options:
        - expedited: 1 to 5 min (highest cost)
        - standard: 3 to 5 hours (medium cost)
        - bulk: 5 to 12 hours (lowest cost)
    - glacier deep archive
      - retrieval options:
        - standard: 12 hours (medium cost)
        - bulk: 48 hours (lowest cost)

### Replication (CRR and SRR)

> automatically copy objects from one S3 bucket to another

- you must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
- buckets can be in different accounts
- buckets can be in different aws accounts
- copying is asynchronous, i.e. data is not copied immediately, there might be a small delay after upload
- 2 types:
  - Cross-Region Replication (CRR): Replicates data to a bucket in a different AWS region
    - use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
  - Same-Region Replication (SRR): Replicates data to a bucket in the same AWS region
    - use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and testing accounts

### s3 data migration

- use cases: large data cloud migrations, decommission (means data center retirement), disaster recovery

#### snow family

- snow code
  - 8 TB of HDD storage
  - 14 TB of SSD storage
- snowball edge: move less than 10 PBs of data
  - storage optimized: 80 TB HDD
  - compute optimized: 42 TB HDD capacity + 28 TB NVMe SSD
- snowmobile: literally a truck
  - use when transfering more than 10 PB
  - each has 100 PB (equals to 100,000 PB) of capacity (1 PB = 1000 TBs)

### EBS vs EFS vs S3

| Feature         | **EFS** (Elastic File System) | **EBS** (Elastic Block Store)  | **S3** (Simple Storage Service) |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Type**        | File Storage                  | Block Storage                  | Object Storage                  |
| **Access**      | Shared (multiple EC2s)        | Single EC2 instance            | HTTP-based, global access       |
| **Use Case**    | Shared files, home dirs, apps | Databases, OS volumes          | Backup, static files, media     |
| **Protocol**    | NFSv4                         | Attached as a disk (block I/O) | REST API / HTTPS                |
| **Scalability** | Auto scales (no limit)        | Fixed size (resize manually)   | Virtually unlimited             |
| **Performance** | High (latency ms-level)       | Very high (low latency)        | Variable (higher latency)       |
| **Durability**  | High (across AZs)             | High (within an AZ)            | Very high (11 nines)            |
| **Pricing**     | Pay per GB + throughput    | Pay per provisioned (allocated up front) GB | Pay per GB + requests |
| **OS Support**  | Linux (only)                  | Linux and Windows              | Any (via API/SDK/browser)       |

- file storage
- block storage
- object storage

- use cases
  - efs: shared file system across multiple ec2 instances
  - ebs: high-performance disk for a single ec2 instance
    - TIP: EB S => S ingle instance
  - s3: object storage with scalability and durability

## lambda

> serverless compute service that lets you run code in response to events

- examples of events
  - file uploads
  - http requests
  - database changes

- properties
  - serverless
  - event-driven
  - short-lived functions: each invocation runs in an isolated environment with max duration of 15 minutes
  - stateless: each function runs independently

### workflow

1. write a function in Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc
1. deploy it to Lambda (manually, with the CLI, or using IaC like Terraform)
1. configure a trigger (e.g. HTTP endpoint, S3 upload)
1. lambda runs your code when the event occurs
1. get billed per request and per compute time (in milliseconds)

use case example: resize images uploaded to an S3 bucket

1. upload triggers an S3 event
1. aws Lambda receives the event, processes the image (e.g. resizes it)
1. stores the output back to S3

## RDS (Relational Database Service)

> managed database service that allows you to set up, operate and scale relational databases in the cloud

- supports multiple engines:
  - [postgresql](./postgresql.md)
  - [mysql](./mysql.md)
  - [mariadb](./mariadb.md)
  - oracle
  - microsoft sql server
  - aurora

- read replica: is a copy of a database that can be used to offload read operations from the primary database
  - doesn't contribute to high availability, since they are all located in a single AZ
- multi-AZ: failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
- multi-region (uses read replicas): spans multiple aws regions (e.g. `sa-east-1` and `us-east-1`)
  - disaster recovery in case of region issue
  - how it works:
