# AWS

> cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services and tools for building and managing applications and infrastructure in the cloud

- cloud computing: the delivery of computing services over the internet
- serverless: server doesn't requires provisioning and scaling
  - e.g. aws lambda, azure functions, google cloud functions
- service: a software that provides functionality and performs a task or set of tasks for your system
  - e.g. apache, nginx, postgresql, auth0
- infrastructure: the physical or virtual resources that support the operation of a system
  - e.g. servers, storage, network, databases, etc

- types of pricing in AWS
  - pay for compute time
  - pay for data stored in the cloud
  - pay only for data transfer out of the cloud
    - data transfer in is free

- options to manage aws
  - aws management console
  - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
  - AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK): allows the access and management of aws services programmatically
    - Used whenever you want to call APIs

- reliability: ability to recover from failures and maintain availability
  - dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
- high availability: design and implementation of systems that are resilient to failures and can continue operating with minimal downtime
  - running instances for the same application on at least 2 Availability Zones
  - key characteristics
    - redundancy
    - failover mechanisms
    - geographic distribution
    - health monitoring
    - scalability and elasticity

- aws global infrastructure
  - region: separate geographic areas (e.g. `us-east-1` or `sa-east-1`)
    - each region is completely independent from others
    - each region has 3 to 6 Availability Zones, with few exceptions (AZ âŠ‚ region)
  - Availability Zone (AZ): isolated locations within each region
  - edge networks (Points of Presence): for content delivery as close as possible to users

- aws global services: services that are NOT tied to a specific region and operate across all regions
  - e.g. IAM, route 53, cloudfront, WAF, shield, aws organizations, aws artifact
  - TIP: if a service manages access, identity or DNS for your entire aws environment, it's likely global

- root user: the original account owner with full administrative access to all AWS services and resources
- IAM users: individual
- IAM groups: collections of IAM users
- AWS organizations: allows management of multiple AWS accounts under one umbrella
  - allows management of permissions
  - AWS organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs): centrally manage and restrict permissions across all accounts

- shared responsibility model: the line of responsibility shifts based on the level of abstraction provided by the service
  - aws is responsible for security **OF** the cloud
    - buildings, computers, storage, network systems, base software (hypervisors, etc)
  - I am responsible for security **IN** the cloud
    - you protect what you do inside the cloud
      - files, data, etc

## AWS CLI

> manage aws resources with CLI commands

- list all IAM users in your AWS account: `aws iam list-users`
- get secret from aws secrets manager: `aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id peso-env-secret --region sa-east-1`

## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

> compute service that allows you to launch virtual servers in the cloud

- instance: a virtual server in the cloud
- AMI: a template for your instance (OS + configs)
- EBS (Elastic Block Store): persistent block storage for instances
- Security Groups: virtual firewalls that control traffic
- key pairs: used for SSH access to Linux or RDP to Windows instances
- elastic IP: static public IP address for your instance

- inbound traffic: traffic that comes into a resource from the outside
  - instance <= traffic = outside
- outbound traffic: traffic that goes out from a resource to an external destination
  - instance = traffic => outside

### workflow

1. choose an AMI (ubuntu, amazon linux, windows, etc)
1. choose an instance type (e.g. t2.micro, m5.large)
1. configure instance details (VPC, subnet, IAM role, etc.)
1. add storage (EBS volumes)
1. add tags (e.g. MyServer)
1. configure security group (firewall rules)
1. launch (with a key pair for SSH)

### shared responsibility model

> defines which security and compliance tasks are handled by AWS and which are handled by the customer

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Varies slightly depending on the aws service.
> depends partially in which category the service belongs: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
> Not every IaaS service has exactly the same responsibility model. The same applies to PaaS and SaaS categories.

|                     | On-site | IaaS             | PaaS                 | SaaS             |
|---------------------|---------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Data**            | You     | You              | You                  | You              |
| **Applications**    | You     | You              | You/Service provider | Service provider |
| **Runtime**         | You     | You              | Service provider     | Service provider |
| **Middleware**      | You     | You              | Service provider     | Service provider |

| **Storage**         | You     | Service provider | Service provider     | Service provider |
| **Networking**      | You     | Service provider | Service provider     | Service provider |

- data: information your application uses (e.g. customer records, documents, transactions)
  - you are ALWAYS responsible for your data
- applications: the actual software you use or build (e.g. web app, analytics tool)
- runtime: the environment where code runs (e.g. JVM, node.js, python interpreter)
- middleware: software that connects applications or services (e.g. message brokers, APIs, databases, caching systems)
- os: the system software that runs on a server or VM (e.g. Linux, Windows Server)
- virtualization: software that abstracts physical hardware into virtual machines (e.g. a hypervisor like VMware or Xen)
- servers: physical or virtual machines that process workloads (CPUs, RAM, etc)
- storage: where your data is saved (e.g. hard drives, SSDs, cloud object storage like Amazon S3)
- networking: The communication layer (e.g. routers, switches, firewalls, internet access, VPCs, load balancers)
  - it allows components to talk to each other or external users

- you/customer: responsibility for security in the cloud
  - customer data
  - platform, applications, IAM
  - OS, networking traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity)
  - client-side and server-side encryption
  - authentication
- aws: responsibility for security of the cloud
  - compute, storage, database, networking

### purchasing options

- on-demand: ideal for short-term use, expensive
  - predictable pricing
  - highest cost but no upfront payment
  - no long-term commitment
- reserved: commit to 1 or 3 years, cheaper
  - long workloads
  - up to 72% discount compared to on-demand
- spot instances: bid for unused capacity, cheapest
  - no guaranteed availability, aws can terminate them when the spot price exceeds your bid price
- savings plans: commit to an amount of usage
  - discount based on long-term usage
- capacity reservations: reserve instance capacity in a specific AZ
- dedicated instances: instances that run on hardware dedicated to your account, but aws manages the host
- dedicated hosts: get an entire physical server to yourself

### sizing and configuration options

- os
- cpu
- ram
- storage space
  - network-attached (ebs and efs)
  - hardware (ec2 instance store)
- network card
- firewall rules: security group
- ec2 user data: script that is launched at the first start of an instance

#### right sizing

> process of looking at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements, which results in lower costs

- when to right size:
  - before a cloud migration
  - continuously after the cloud onboarding process (requirements change over time)

- tools that can help: cloudwatch, cost explorer, trusted advisor

### ec2 instance tenancy

- shared (default): multiple aws accounts may share the same physical hardware
- dedicated instance: instance runs on single-tenant hardware
- dedicated host: instance runs on a physical server with ec2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use

### ec2 image builder

> automate the creation, testing and distribution of AMIs or container images

- can be run on a schedule (weekly, whenever packages are updated, etc)

1. ec2 image builder initiates temporary builder ec2 instance
1. temporary builder ec2 instance builds the image
1. once the image is built, it is saved as an AMI
1. new ec2 instance is launched to test ec2 instance, if it fails, the pipeline stops here
1. if the test is successful, the AMI is made available to other aws regions or accounts

### local ec2 instance store

> fast, ephemeral block-level storage that is physically attached to the host machine running your ec2 instance

- block-level storage: disk is composed by blocks
  - each block has a unique address
  - os can read/write any block
- high-performance hardware disk
- **loses storage if stopped (ephemeral)**
- good buffer/cache/temporary content
- risk of data loss if hardware fails
- backups and replication are your responsibility

### EBS (Elastic Block Store)

> provides block-level storage that can be attached to ec2 instances

- tightly integrated with Amazon EC2
- block-level storage: refers to a type of data storage where data is saved in fixed-sized chunks called blocks
  - each block has its own address
  - the system can read/write to these blocks individually

#### EBS snapshots

> backup for an ebs volume

- it's recommended to detach ebs volume to do a snapshot
- use ebs snapshots as a buffer to copy ebs volumes across AZ

## IAM (Identity and Access Management)

> manage access to AWS services and resources securely

- root account/user: has complete and unrestricted access to all aws services and billing features in the account
  - original identity created when you dign up for aws account
  - root user is not an IAM user
  - capabilities
    - change account settings
    - close your aws account
    - change or cancel your aws support plan
    - register as seller in the reserved instance marketplace
- IAM user: individual user identity created and managed within an AWS account using the IAM service

### Policy structure

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "Policy12345",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowListBuckets",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "AllowGetObjects",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

- `Version`: the version of the policy language, defined by date
- `ID`: optional identifier for the policy
- `Statement`: contains individual permission rules
  - `"Sid": "AllowListBuckets"` (Statement ID): unique identifier for this permission block
  - `Effect`: defines if this permission is allowed or not
  - `"Action": "s3:GetObject"`: allows the use to list objects in the root of the specified S3 bucket
  - `Resource`: list of resources to which the actions apply
  - `Condition`: conditions for when this policy is in effect

- IAM Password Policy: You can decide the requirements for password creation

- MFA (Multi Factor Authentication): multi-step account login process that requires users to enter more information than just a password
  - e.g. password && (code sent to email || secret question || fingerprint scan)

- IAM Policy: set of permissions for aws resources
  - a policy can exist without a role, but a role can't do anything useful without a policy
- IAM Roles: identity that grants temporary permissions to aws services or users to perform tasks
  - set of IAM policies

### IAM role

> identity in aws that you can assume temporarily to get specific permissions

- use cases
  - grant temporary access to aws services without long-term credentials
  - assign permissions to services like ec2 or lambda
  - to switch roles across accounts securely

- key components of a role:
  - trust policy: defines who can assume the role (e.g. ec2, lambda, another account)
  - permissions policy defines what the role can do (e.g. access s3, write logs)
  - session duration
  - assume role

### shared responsibility

- aws
  - infrastructure
  - configuration and vulnerability analysis
  - compliance validation
- me
  - users, groups, roles, policies, management and monitoring
  - enable MFA on all accounts
  - rotate all keys often
  - use iam tools to apply appropriate permissions

### IAM Security Tools

- IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
- IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
  - use this information to revise your policies (least privilege principle)
- IAM policy simulator: test and debug IAM policies to check what actions are allowed/denied for specific users, groups, roles

### IAM Guidelines and Best Practices

- don't use the root account (except for aws account setup)
- don't create multiple aws accounts, create aws users within an aws account
- assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
  - if you are responsible for the company resources
    - create a groups with the policy "administrator access" and create an aws user that belongs to this group
- create strong password policy
  - use and enforce MFA
- create and use roles to give permisssions to aws srevices

- dedicated host: your instance runs on a physical server fully dedicated to your use
  - an isolated server with configurations you can control

### IAM access analyzer

> used to find out which resources are shared outside your trusted boundaries (called a Zone of Trust)

- checks these types of resources:
  - s3 buckets, iam roles, kms keys, lambda functions, sqs queues, Secrets Manager secrets
- iam access analyzer creates a finding if a resource (like an s3 bucket or iam role) allows access from:
  - an aws not in your organization
  - the public internet
  - anonymous users
  - unrelated external aws account

## security groups

> facilitates managing network traffic

- acts as a "firewall"
- supports ALLOW rules only
- define:
  - access to ports
  - authorized IP ranges (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - control of inbound and outbound network traffic
- can be attached to multiple instances
- locked down to a region/VPC combination
- lives "outside" the EC2
  - if traffic is blocked, the EC2 instance won't see it

> [!TIP]
> it's good to keep 1 separate security group for SSH access.
> if your application is not accessible (time out), then it's a security group issue.
> if you application gives a "connection refused" error, then it's an application error or it's not launched.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> all inbound traffic is blocked by default
> all outbound traffic is authorized by default

- Ports:
  - 22 = SSH (Secure Shell): log into a linux instance
  - 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): log into a windows instance
  - 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
  - 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
  - 80 = HTTP : access unsecured websites
  - 443 = HTTPS: access secured websites

#### security groups vs firewalls

| Feature  | AWS Security Groups                                       | Traditional Firewalls (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`) |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Level    | AWS-level (cloud)                                         | OS-level (server)                               |
| Type     | Virtual firewall for EC2 and services                     | Software firewall on the OS                     |
| Rules    | Stateful (return traffic automatically allowed)           | Stateful or stateless                           |
| Scope    | Applied per EC2 instance                                  | Applies to whole server                         |
| Use Case | Allow inbound on port 22 from your IP, or 443 to everyone | Block/allow ports directly on EC2 OS            |

### SSH Access

1. create an identity file `.pem` for SSH:
1. EC2 Dashboard => Key Pair => Create Key Pair
1. copy the public IP of the instance (used in the SSH command)
1. move the `.pem` file to a secure location and restrict permissions: `chmod 0400 <file>.pem`
1. SSH into the instance: `ssh -i <file>.pem ec2-user@<public_IP>`

## VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

> virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the cloud

- allows management over IP addresses, subnets, routing and security
- must have a CIDR block
- elastic ip: fixed public IPv4 address attached to ec2 instance
  - ongoing cost if not attached to ec2 instance or if the instance is stopped
- allows the creation of public and private subnets
  - subnet: smaller network inside larger network
    - helps organize and manage traffic in a network by dividing it into chunks
    - subnets allow better allocation of IPs from a larger IP range
    - each subnet in aws is associated with one route table
    - use CIDR notation (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`)

- **public vs private subnet**
  - public subnets in AWS need an Internet Gateway to allow internet access
    - this means:
      - instances can send traffic to the internet
      - instances can receive traffic from the internet, if security rules allows it
  - private subnets do not have route to internet gateway
    - this means:
      - instances CANNOT initiate outbound internet traffic (unless via NAT gateway)
      - instances CANNOT receive ANY inbound traffic directly from the internet

| Feature        | Route Tables       | Security Groups            | Internet Gateway               |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Scope**      | Subnet-level       | Instance-level             | VPC-level                      |
| **Purpose**    | Direct traffic     | Allow or deny traffic      | Enable internet connectivity   |
| **Layer**      | Layer 3 (Network)  | Layer 4 (Transport)        | Layer 3 (Network)              |
| **Stateful?**  | No                 | Yes                        | Yes                            |
| **Controls**   | Where traffic goes | Whether traffic is allowed | Provides external access point |
| **Applied To** | Subnets            | EC2 instances, ENIs        | Entire VPC                     |

- route table: defines how traffic flows within the VPC (between subnets) and between the VPC and external networks (like the internet), by specifying the next hop for outbound traffic
  - hop: one step in the path that network traffic takes from a source to a destination
    - e.g. if a packet goes from a computer â†’ to a router â†’ to another router â†’ to the destination server, that's 3 hops
  - only controls outbound routing (cannot restrict inbound traffic)
  - contains rules like:
    - to reach the internet (0.0.0.0/0), go through the Internet Gateway
    - to reach the private subnet, stay local
  - each subnet is associated with a route table
  - only one route table per subnet is allowed
  - a vpc can have multiple route tables
- internet gateway: allows instances in vpc to send traffic to the internet and enables the instances to receive responses from the internet
  - attached to a VPC
  - required for ec2 instances in public subnets to:
    - download packages
    - be accessed via SSH or a browser
- NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway (aws-managed): managed aws service that allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection back
  - e.g. private ec2 can download updates or access external APIs without being publicly exposed
  - usually are placed in a public subnet and route private subnet traffic through it
- NAT instances (self-managed): is an ec2 instance configured manually to perform the same function as NAT gateway

- Network ACL (Access Control List): security layer used in networks to control inbound/outbound traffic at the subnet level
  - stateless: rules must be defined for both inbound and outbound traffic
  - supports ALLOW and DENY rules
  - rules only include IP addresses

### ENI (Elastic Network Interface)

> manages network connectivity for an ec2 instance in a vpc

- allows you to create multiple network interfaces for an ec2 instance
- use cases
  - creating a management network interface
  - creating a network interface for traffic that needs to be isolated from other traffic

### vpc flow logs

> feature that captures information about the ip traffic going to and from network interfaces

- network interface: virtual network card that connects ec2 instances and other aws resources to a vpc network
- captures network information from aws managed interfaces like ELB, elasticache, rds, aurora, etc
- vpc flow logs data can go to S3, cloudwatch logs, kinesis data firehose
- what the vpc flow logs capture
  - source ip and destination ip
  - source port and destination port
  - protocol (tcp, udp)
  - traffic acceptance (accept or reject)
  - bytes transferred

### endpoints

> privately connect VPC to aws services without using public IPs or going through the internet

- provides better security and lower latency to access aws services
- VPC endpoint gateway if you want to connect to s3 or DynamoDB
- VPC endpoint interface if you want to connect to other aws services

### peering

> connect 2 VPCs privately using aws' network and make them behave as if they are the same network

- IP address ranges can't overlap

### PrivateLink

> privately connect to a service in a 3rd party vpc

- most secure and scalable way to
  - expose a service to 1000s of vpcs
- doesn't require
  - vpc peering
  - internet gateway
  - nat
  - route tables
- requires
  - network load balancer
  - [ENI](#eni-elastic-network-interface)

### direct connect + site-to-site vpn

- site-to-site vpn: connect on-premises network to your aws vpc
  - secure "bridge" between physical data center and cloud network
- direct connect (DX): dedicated network connection between your on-premises, bypassing the public internet

### client vpn

> securely access AWS resources and on-premises networks that are not publicly accessible (i.e. private networks)

- the connection goes over the public internet, but the traffic is encrypted end-to-end
- allows your device to act as if it's inside the private network

### transit gateway

> connecto to multiple VPCs and/or on-premises infrastructure through a centralized hub

- works with
  - connect gateway
  - vpn connections
  - vpc
  - subnets
  - internet gateway
  - nat gateway/instances
  - nacl
  - security groups
  - vpc peering
  - elastic ip
  - vpc endpoints
  - PrivateLink
  - vpc flow logs
  - site-to-site vpn
  - client vpc
  - direct connect
  - transit gateway

## lambda

> serverless compute service that lets you run code in response to events

- short-lived functions: each invocation runs in an isolated environment with max duration of 15 minutes
- stateless: each function runs independently
- price based on number of calls and duration of compute time
- increasing ram also improves cpu and network
- event-driven
  - examples of events
    - file uploads
    - http requests
    - database changes
- supports
  - node.js
  - python
  - golang
  - java
  - c# (.NET core and powershell)

### workflow

1. write a function in Python, Node.js, Java, Go, etc
1. deploy it to Lambda (manually, with the CLI, or using IaC like Terraform)
1. configure a trigger (e.g. HTTP endpoint, S3 upload)
1. lambda runs your code when the event occurs
1. get billed per request and per compute time (in milliseconds)

use case example: resize images uploaded to an S3 bucket

1. upload triggers an S3 event
1. aws Lambda receives the event, processes the image (e.g. resizes it)
1. stores the output back to S3

## RDS (Relational Database Service)

> managed database service that allows you to set up, operate and scale relational databases in the cloud

- supports multiple engines:
  - [postgresql](./postgresql.md)
  - [mysql](./mysql.md)
  - [mariadb](./mariadb.md)
  - oracle
  - microsoft sql server
  - aurora

- read replica: is a copy of a database that can be used to offload read operations from the primary database
  - doesn't contribute to high availability, since they are all located in a single AZ
- multi-AZ: failover in case of AZ outage (high availability)
- multi-region (uses read replicas): spans multiple aws regions (e.g. `sa-east-1` and `us-east-1`)
  - disaster recovery in case of region issue
  - how it works:
    - Your main DB lives in one region (e.g. eu-west-1 in Ireland)
    - you create read replicas in other regions (e.g. U.S. or Asia)
    - local apps can read from these replicas â€” reduces latency
    - writes still go to the main DB only

## S3 (Simple Storage Service)

> scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere on the web

- use cases
  - storage
  - backup and restore
  - application hosting
  - static websites
  - [data lake](/data_warehouse.md#types-of-data-repositories) and big data analytics
  - web hosting (static files)
  - media storage and distribution
  - application assets (images, audio, etc)
  - log storage

- properties
  - serverless: no server or infrastructure to manage
  - scalable: automatically scales to any amount of data
  - durable
  - event-driven: can trigger lambda, sqs, sns on object creation or deletion
  - durable: 11 9s (99.999999999%) durability

- versioning: option to retain multiple versions of objects
- there are no real folders
- max object size is 5 TB
  - if file is bigger than 5 TB, upload is segmented into multiple parts

- server-side encryption is enabled by default (instead of client-side encryption)
- you can enable public access with an S3 bucket policy
- to give user access to S3, use IAM policy to give access
- to give access to an EC2 instance, always use EC2 instance roles with IAM permissions
- to give access to IAM User in another AWS account, create a bucket policy that allows access to that specific user

- key: unique identifier for an object within a bucket (often a filename or path)
  - must be unique in the bucket
  - similar to full file path
    - aren't directories, just long names that contain slashes ("/")
  - prefix: path without file name
- object (similar to file): stored data (file + metadata + unique key)
- url structure to an s3 object: `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>`
  - `https://my-unique-bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/documents/report.pdf`
- bucket (similar to directory): container that stores objects
  - must have unique name globally
  - created in a region
  - pay attention to naming requirements
    - 3 to 63 characters
    - no spaces or underscores
    - no leading or trailing dots or hyphens
    - names can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, periods and hyphens
- region: bucket location (affects latency)

> [!NOTE]
> When you upload data (objects), server-side encryption is enabled by default, rather than client-side encryption.
> Server-side encryption ensures that this stored data is encrypted so that even if someone gains access to the raw storage, they can't read your data.

- compatible databases:
  - [postgresql](./postgresql.md)
  - [mysql](./mysql.md)
  - [mariadb](./mariadb.md)
  - oracle
  - microsoft sql server
  - aurora

- bucket policies examples:
  - you can enable public access with an S3 Bucket Policy
  - to give user access to S3, use IAM policy to give access
  - to give access to an EC2 instance, always use EC2 instance roles with IAM permissions
  - to give access to IAM User in another AWS account, create a bucket policy that allows access to that specific user

> [!WARNING]
> to fix 403 error, you need to give public access to your bucket

### workflow

1. create a bucket (e.g. `my-app-assets` in `sa-east-1`)
1. upload an object (`logo.png`)
1. access it with: `https://my-app-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/logo.png`
1. use IAM policies or s3 bucket policies to control access

#### aws cli example

```bash
# create a bucket
aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name

# upload a file
aws s3 cp ./file.txt s3://my-bucket-name/

# download a file
aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket-name/file.txt .

# list files
aws s3 ls s3://my-bucket-name/
```

### shared responsibility model

- aws is responsible for
  - infrastructure
    - global security
    - durability
    - availability
    - sustain concurrent loss of data in 2 facilities
  - configuration and vulnerability analysis
  - compliance validation
- me
  - s3 versioning
  - s3 bucket policies
  - s3 replication setup
  - logging and monitoring
  - s3 storage classes
  - data encryption at rest and in transit

### storage classes

> determines availability, durability and cost

- durability: how many times an object is going to be lost by S3 (likelihood of data loss)
  - same for all storages classes: 99.999999999% (11 9's)
- availability: percentage of time where a service is available
  - varies depending on storage class

- standard: frequently accesses data
  - use cases: big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications, content distribution
  - instant data retrieval
  - most expensive
- intelligent-tiering: automatically moves data between frequent/infrequent tiers
  - tiers:
    - frequent access tier: default tier
    - infrequent access tier: objects not accessed for 30 days
    - archive instant access tier: objects not accessed for 90 days
    - archive access tier: configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
    - deep archive access tier: configurable from 180 days to 700+ days
- standard IA (Infrequent Access)
  - pay to retrieve data
  - 99% availability
  - use cases: disaster recovery, backups

    - glacier flexible retrieval
      - retrieval options:
        - expedited: 1 to 5 min (highest cost)
        - standard: 3 to 5 hours (medium cost)
        - bulk: 5 to 12 hours (lowest cost)
    - glacier deep archive
      - retrieval options:
        - standard: 12 hours (medium cost)
        - bulk: under 24 hours (lowest cost)

### Replication (CRR and SRR)

> automatically copy objects from one S3 bucket to another

- you must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
- buckets can be in different accounts
- buckets can be in different aws accounts
- copying is asynchronous, i.e. data is not copied immediately, there might be a small delay after upload
- 2 types:
  - Cross-Region Replication (CRR): Replicates data to a bucket in a different AWS region
    - use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
  - Same-Region Replication (SRR): Replicates data to a bucket in the same AWS region
    - use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and testing accounts

### s3 data migration

- use cases: large data cloud migrations, decommission (means data center retirement), disaster recovery

#### snow family

- snow code
  - 8 TB of HDD storage
  - 14 TB of SSD storage
- snowball edge: move less than 10 PBs of data
  - storage optimized: 80 TB HDD
  - compute optimized: 42 TB HDD capacity + 28 TB NVMe SSD
- snowmobile: literally a truck
  - use when transfering more than 10 PB
  - each has 100 PB (equals to 100,000 PB) of capacity (1 PB = 1000 TBs)
