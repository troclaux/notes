- primitives: fundamental data types that are not composed of other data types
  - e.g. integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, strings, null or undefined values

- pass by value: actual value of the argument is passed
- pass by reference: address to the actual argument is passed

- namespace: declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (names of types, functions, variables) inside it
- anonymous function: function that is defined without name

- high-order functions: function that takes another function as an argument
- first-class citizen: objects that can be:
  - created at runtime
  - passed as arguments to other functions
  - returned as values from other functions
  - stored in data structures
  - used as values in expressions

- concurrency: ability of a program to manage multiple tasks at the same time
  - can happen on a single-core system with task switching
- parallelism: ability to execute multiple tasks at the same time
  - requires a multi-core system where multiple tasks can be executed simultaneously
- asynchronous: starting a task that runs on the background without blocking the main program flow
  - means that the program performs non-blocking tasks, usually involving I/O operations
