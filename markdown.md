[markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

- `**` for bold
- `_` for italic

- only have 1 H1 per markdown file
- limit depth to H3 or H4

- lists should be surrounded by a blank line
- don't end list items with a period
- all items in a list should use the number 1. rather than incrementing each item
  - markdown will automatically number the items
  - this makes it easier to reorder items

- there should be a single blank line between markdown blocks of different types
  - e.g. between a list and a code block
  - don't use more than 1 blank line

- remove trailing whitespace
- use spaces instead of tabs
