## compiled vs interpreted

- compiled languages: C, C++, Golang, Rust
  - source code is transformed into machine code (binary code) before it is executed
  - compiled binary is specific to the architecture and OS it was compiled for
  - a machine doesn't need the compiler to run the compiled executable
  - faster execution time
- interpreted languages: JavaScript, Python, Ruby
  - source code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime
  - as long as the OS has an interpreter, the code can be run on any platform
  - a machine needs the interpreter to run the source code
  - slower execution time

## compilation process

> process that translates source code written in high level programming languages into machine code

1. preprocessor (hello.c => hello.i)
1. compiler (hello.i => hello.s)
1. assembler (hello.s => hello.o)
1. linker (hello.o => hello)
1. loader (hello)
1. execution

> [!NOTE]
> the file extensions used are for the c programming languages

- other languages will translate to different types of files

1. preprocessing:
- this is done by the preprocessor
- generates expanded code
2. compilation: source code is compiled into assembly code
- this is done by the compiler
3. assembly: assembly code is assembled into machine code
- this is done by the assembler
- machine code: binary representation of the code
4. linking: machine code is linked with libraries and other object files
- this is done by the linker
- object files: files that contain machine code that has been generated by a compiler or assembler
  - usually named with a .o or .obj extension
5. loading: executable file is loaded into memory by the operating system
- also sets up necessary memory protection and access controls
- access controls: restricts access of programs to computer resources
  - examples of access controls:
    - memory protection
    - file system access
    - network access
6. execution: CPU executes the machine code instructions in memory
- fetches instructions from memory
- decodes instructions
- executes instructions according to the instruction set architecture (ISA)
