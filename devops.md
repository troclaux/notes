# DevOps

> set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently and reliably

- combination of culture, practices and tools that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services

## key components

- core principles:
  - automation
  - collaboration and communication
  - CI/CD
    - Continuous Integration (CI): practice of automatically integrating code changes from developers into shared repository
      - verify each integration with automated builds and tests to detect problems early
    - Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): process of automatically deploying code changes to production environment after the code has been built and tested
  - version control
  - infrastructure as code
  - microservices architecture: architecture where a large application is split into smaller, independent services
  - monitoring and logging
  - security integration (DevSecOps)

- benefits:
  - shorter release cycle
  - faster time to market
  - improved collaboration
  - better quality code
  - reduced development costs
  - increased consistency and reliability
  - faster problem resolution
  - enhanced security

- tools commonly used for:
  - version control: git
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
  - containerization: docker
  - orchestration: kubernetes
  - infrastructure: ansible, terraform
  - monitoring: prometheus, grafana
